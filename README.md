# 1secEmail-Telegram-BOT
Telegram bot that can create temporary mail for receiving and sending letters
The bot was created for entertainment purposes.



A database SQL for working with multiple users was implemented


Commands that the bot accepts:

/start - Welcome message with instructions.
/create_mail - Create a new temporary mailbox. If the mail already exists, it is deleted and a new one is created.
/check_mail - Checks incoming messages to the created mail and displays them to the user.
